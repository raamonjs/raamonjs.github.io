          <p id="intro-p">
            I first got interested in programming when I took a Java course on
            Udemy. It eventually led to me acquiring an interest in web
            development by creating some simple pages using HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. I've also learned so much from the online community by
            collaborating with others on a Discord server. We'd usually solve
            algorithmic problems together on a Zoom call and discuss all the
            possible ways to reach a solution. It's something I enjoy doing
            because there's always something you can learn from others.

              Gaming has always been something that I've been passionate about
              ever since I first played "Kung Fu" on the Nintendo Entertainment
              System.

              Basketball is also something that I've always had an interest in.
              Whether it be playing it or watching the NBA.
