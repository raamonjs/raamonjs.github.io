            </header>
            <p id="intro-p">
              I first got interested in development when I would use the
              developer tools on Google Chrome in high school. I thought it was
              cool how you were able to change content on a webpage if you knew
              where to look. For the most part it was for memes, but eventually
              it got me interested in programming languages which in turn led me
              to learning Java. Obviously, I got confused along the way but
              being open to listen to others and receiving constructive
              criticism led to me becoming a better programmer.
            </p>
            <strong><p>Interests outside of web development:</p></strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Gaming has always been an interest since I first played Kung Fu
                on NES.
              </li>
              <li>
                Anime is something I've been interested ever since I first
                watched Dragon Ball Z when I was younger.
